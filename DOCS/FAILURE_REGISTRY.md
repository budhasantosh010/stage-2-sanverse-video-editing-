# Failure Registry

Record failures that can teach the project, including rejected architectural assumptions and misleading verification.

| ID | Date | Area | Failure or risk | Status | Next evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-001 | 2026-07-12 | Renderer | No renderer has been proven for both interactive preview and final export | Open; FFmpeg static fixture measured | HyperFrames, hybrid, motion, and preview/export comparisons |
| RISK-002 | 2026-07-12 | AI providers | Free OpenCode Zen/NVIDIA availability, schemas, rate limits, and terms may change | Open | Provider adapter probe in G4, not core coupling |
| RISK-003 | 2026-07-12 | Accuracy | Semantic point/draw/chat intent cannot honestly be guaranteed at 100% | Managed | Clarification, preview, fail-closed evaluation |
| RISK-004 | 2026-07-12 | Continuity | Hooks may require a new trusted session before integrated firing can be verified | Open | Restart/session verification after baseline |
| RISK-005 | 2026-07-12 | Scope | Attempting full NLE parity would delay the first useful workflow | Managed | Goal gates and deferred-ideas register |

## Entry rules

Do not delete a failure because it is fixed. Mark it resolved, link evidence, and preserve what prevented recurrence.
