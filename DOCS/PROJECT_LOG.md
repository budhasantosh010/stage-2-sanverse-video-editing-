# Project Log

## 2026-07-12 — G0 initiated

- Owner approved starting Stage 2 as a separate production-grade project.
- Clarified that “production SaaS infrastructure now” means sound code architecture and evolution boundaries, not implementing all operational SaaS features immediately.
- Confirmed the owner is the first real tester and the product must reduce editing from hours to minutes.
- Confirmed black-and-white minimal branding inspired by the cleanliness of OpenDesign.
- Audited the prior anti-drift template and selected only lightweight, deterministic safeguards for the initial baseline.
- Wrote the macro goal, requirements, decisions, goal map, interface principles, risks, and G1 plan.
- Product implementation remains intentionally unstarted until the G0 verification and owner gate close.

## 2026-07-12 — G0 closed and G1 authorized

- Owner created `budhasantosh010/stage-2-sanverse-video-editing-` and authorized direct Git/PowerShell access.
- Verified SSH access and inspected the GitHub initial commit before changing remote history.
- Preserved GitHub's placeholder initial commit using a non-destructive merge and pushed the verified G0 baseline.
- Remote baseline after merge: `751911f` on `main`.
- Owner explicitly instructed work to continue, satisfying the G1 entry gate.
- Active work is now limited to the interface workflow/wireframe and renderer feasibility spike defined in the approved G1 plan.

## 2026-07-12 — G1 first-edit design drafted

- Defined the first nameplate-edit job story around completing one edit in under a minute without editor terminology.
- Mapped empty, importing, ready, selecting, clarification, proposal, preview, accepted, undo/export, and recoverable-failure states.
- Produced and visually verified a black-and-white Studio wireframe.
- Preserved canvas-first interaction, plain-language proposal details, preview-before-acceptance, and a simple moment strip.
- G1-01 remains in progress until the owner reviews the workflow; no product behavior has been implemented.

## 2026-07-12 — Owner corrected the entry experience

- Owner clarified that the existing Studio wireframe is Screen 2, not the first-arrival experience.
- Screen 1 must use OpenDesign-like progressive disclosure: a calm Home centered on chat/upload, drag-and-drop entry, and recent projects.
- Editing tools, canvas, proposal/history panel, and time strip appear only after the user supplies or opens a video project.
- Updated the durable requirement, interface decision, active G1 plan, flow, and state model before continuing visual work.
- Created and visually checked a separate Home wireframe; preserved the original editing workspace as Screen 2.
